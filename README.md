# Plot_Kernel_Density_Estimation
The path to read the csv data is set in mainwindow.cpp, if you want to use your own csv file, modify the fname variable. 

Before kde calculation, preprocessing will be performed. The preprocessing method is to delete the first quartile and the third quartile. If you donâ€™t want to do preprocessing, just turn off the preprocessing function.

The kernel density estimation is shown in the following figure.
